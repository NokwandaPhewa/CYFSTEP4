        <h2 id="first-post" class="heading">Why I started coding</h2>
        <h6 class="date">Mon 5:45p PM 4/18/25</h6>
        
        <p>The main reason I started learning to code was to enhance my skills in Computer Engineering. As a student in this field, I quickly realized that coding is a crucial skill that would complement my studies and allow me to better understand the practical aspects of my courses. Programming provides me with a way to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, and it also excites me to solve complex problems. I'm eager to continue expanding my coding abilities as they directly contribute to my future career in technology and engineering.</p>
        
        <h2 id="second-post" class="heading">What have I been studying?</h2>
        <h6 class="date">Mon 12:07p PM 4/18/25</h6>
        
        <p>Currently, I'm studying a range of topics in Computer Engineering, including Software Design, Computer Architecture, and Electronics. Alongside my coursework, I’ve been honing my coding skills, especially focusing on languages like Java and Python, which are useful for both academic and professional applications. I’ve also been experimenting with projects related to operating systems and virtual machines, which are essential aspects of my field.</p>
        
        <p>One of the most exciting aspects of my studies is that I get to integrate my coding practice with my academic work, such as when I'm developing technical documentation or building software for various projects. This integration allows me to strengthen both my problem-solving abilities and my theoretical understanding.</p>
        
        <p id="future-plans">In the future, I plan to continue refining my programming skills and work on building more complex projects, such as creating software that interacts with hardware. This will not only improve my skills as a programmer but also prepare me for tackling real-world engineering challenges.</p>
